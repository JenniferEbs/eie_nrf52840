Git Cheatsheet

git commit  
Records changes to the repository.

  -m "message" adds a commit message inline  
  --amend modifies the previous commit  
Behavior changes with arguments: Yes. --amend edits the last commit instead of creating a new one.

git branch  
Lists, creates, or deletes branches.  
Arguments:  
  branch-name creates a new branch  
  -d branch-name deletes a branch  
  (no arguments) lists all branches  
Behavior changes with arguments: Yes. No arguments list branches; with one, it creates or deletes depending on flags.

git checkout  
Switches branches or restores files.  
Arguments:  
  branch-name switches to that branch  
  -b new-branch creates and switches to a new branch  
  file-name restores a file from a commit

git pull  
Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository.  
Arguments:  
  origin branch-name pulls from a specific remote and branch  
Behavior changes with arguments: Slightly. You can specify where to pull from.

git push  
Sends your commits to a remote repository.  
Arguments:  
  origin branch-name pushes to a specific remote and branch  
  --force forces the push  
  -u <remote> <branch> sets the upstream tracking reference  
Note about -u:  
  The -u option tells Git to remember the remote and branch you're pushing to.  
  After using it once, you can just type git push or git pull without specifying the remote and branch again.  
  It's like saying, "From now on, this branch should track that remote branch."  
Behavior changes with arguments: Yes. You can push different branches, force updates, or set upstream tracking. -u <remote> <branch> sets the upstream tracking reference
